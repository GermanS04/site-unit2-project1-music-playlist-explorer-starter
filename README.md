### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I feel that the topics we saw in the labs covered the basics and were very well explained, although, I felt somewhat unprepared to do the feature of populating the page and modal with playlists and songs using the JSON object on JavaScript to show it HTMLbcrljknvbubknnurtkljuijhcnhllktb.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time would have added the features of add and edit playlist, as well as change the way which I map the playlist cards in the script JavaScript file because when I did it I didn't had all the knowledge I now have on how to insert to a HTML using JavaScript so I hardcoded most of it rather than using some functions I found about later on the project.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

On the demo I did, the features I implemented worked and I felt pretty satisfied with the final design of the page. There was one thing that didn't went as planned, it was keeping track of the like of a playlist since it kept refreshing when looking on the search bar. From my peers I noticed some design details that I would like to try next time, like a background gradient that changes colors through time and a translucent header bar that stays in place rather than hide when scrolling down.
